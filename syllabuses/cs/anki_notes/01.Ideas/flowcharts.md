*Блок-схема* - графическое представление алгоритма, метода решения задачи. Шаги изображаются в виде блоков, соединенных между собой линиями, указывающими направление последовательности.

Как и псевдокод, это язык, способ описания/представления алгоритмов.

*Flowchart* - graphic (diagrammatic) representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. It shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.
*System flowcharts* are a way of displaying how data flows in a system and how decisions are made to control events.

Blocks:
- Flowline (Arrowhead) - process's order of operation
- Terminal - beginning and ending of a program or sub-process. Oval / stadium / rounded (fillet) rectangle
- Process - changes value, form, or location of data. Rectangle
- Decision - determines which one of the two paths the program will take. Diamond / rhombus
- Input/Output - process of inputting and outputting data. Parallelogram
- Annotation (Comment) - additional information about a step. Open rectangle with a dashed or solid line
- Predefined Process - named process defined elsewhere. Rectangle with double-struck vertical edges
- On-page Connector - pairs of labeled connectors replace long or confusing lines on a page. Small circle with a letter inside
- Off-page Connector - labeled connector for use when the target is on another page. Home plate-shaped pentagon
- Parallel processing - two horizontal lines at the beginning or ending of simultaneous operations

Questions:

- What is the purpose of a flowchart?
  * Designing and documenting simple processes or programs
  * Help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process
  * And perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and bottlenecks
