_Class:_ Adapter
_Parent class:_ Target (our base class)
_Third-party class:_ Adaptee (must be adopted to Target)
Since PHP doesn't support multiple inheritance we use object-based version of the pattern

||*Target*|*Adaptee*|
|*Adapter*|<code>implements Target</code>|<code>__construct(Adaptee $adaptee)</code>|
